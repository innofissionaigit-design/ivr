"""Composes the spoken reply from TOOL DATA, never from the LLM's
own words, for any intent where a fact (a price, a date, a confirmation
ID) is at stake.

This is the same discipline voicerx/gate.py already applies to drug names
("the SLM proposes, the gazetteer decides") ported to this domain: the LLM
may decide WHAT the caller wants and WHICH slots it heard, but the actual
number in the caller's ear always comes from the Spring Boot response,
substituted into a fixed template. The model never gets a chance to
misremember or round a price it was merely shown a moment ago.

Only "smalltalk" skips this file entirely and uses the LLM's own
direct_reply_bn -- there is no fact to get wrong in "নমস্কার" or "ধন্যবাদ".

LANGUAGE SUPPORT:
- Primary: Bengali (বাংলা) - default for TTS synthesis
- Secondary: English - for English-speaking callers
- Tertiary: Hinglish (Hindi-English mix) - for mixed-language contexts
- Also supported by the booking-confirmation prompts (below): Banglish
  (Bengali-English mix) -- Kolkata callers code-switch Bengali with
  English at least as often as Hindi with English, and "hinglish" here
  is Hindi vocabulary, not Bengali, so a Bengali-English code-switcher
  needs its own branch rather than being folded into "hinglish".
All templates preserve exact values regardless of language.

SPOKEN PUNCTUATION ("Answers sound like a person, not a database row"):
No template here ever emits a field label followed by a colon (e.g.
"Sample: X", "Confirmation number: Y") -- a spoken colon or bracket reads
to a caller as a database field, not a sentence, which is exactly what
this story bans. Every value is folded into a natural clause instead
("You'll need to give a X sample.", "Your confirmation number is Y.").
This is unrelated to the colons inside raw values like a 24h time
("14:30") -- those are consumed by agent/bn_normalize.py's verbalize()
at synthesis time (see tts.py) before anything is actually spoken, so
they were never the problem; only a literal label-colon that survives
verbalize() unchanged is. test_reply_templates_fidelity.py enforces this
across every function and language with an automated check that runs
output through verbalize() and fails the build if a colon or bracket
survives.

    """Every critical value is read back before it is used (Answer Quality
    and Grounding): this is spoken once all five booking fields are known,
    BEFORE main.py ever calls book_appointment(). A misheard phone digit
    or date gets caught here, not after the write.

    Same passthrough discipline test_reply_templates_fidelity.py already
    locks in for booking_reply(): values are dropped into the sentence
    exactly as slot_parse.py produced them (ISO date, 24h "HH:MM", raw
    phone digits) with no reformatting here. agent/tts.py's synthesize()
    runs bn_normalize.verbalize() on this text before it reaches the
    caller's ear, which is what turns the ISO date/time and the phone
    digits into spoken words digit-faithfully -- nothing in this function
    needs to do that itself.

    `language` covers all four this system speaks: "bengali" (default),
    "english", "hinglish" (Hindi-English), and "banglish" (Bengali-English
    -- Kolkata's own code-switch, distinct from Hindi-English and not the
    same as "hinglish"). The doctor's name goes through
    _spoken_doctor_name() rather than being read straight off `slots`, so
    the honorific matches the sentence's language ("ডাঃ" only in Bengali,
    "Dr." otherwise) instead of a Bengali prefix landing in the middle of
    an English or transliterated sentence.

    KNOWN LIMITATION, inherited from booking_reply()/doctor_availability_
    reply() and not introduced here: `slots` never carries a
    `doctor_name_bn` alias today -- main.py/main_pcm.py only ever store
    the catalogue's plain `doctor_name` in pending["slots"], even on the
    turns where a Bengali alias WAS available (see _continue_pending's
    "doctor_choice" state, which has the alias in `candidates` and drops
    it once matched). _spoken_doctor_name() checks for the alias first
    and uses it the moment some future call site starts threading it
    through, but until that data-flow gap is closed, the Bengali branch
    below may still speak the doctor's Latin-script catalogue name inside
    an otherwise-Bengali sentence. That gap is pre-existing and shared
    with booking_reply(); closing it needs pending["slots"] to start
    carrying the alias, which is a data-flow change beyond this story.
